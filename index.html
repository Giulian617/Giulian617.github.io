            <h2>The history of minesweeper</h2>
            <p>
                Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre, generally played on personal computers. The game featurea
                a grid of clickable squares with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to
                clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines
                in each field.
            </p>
            <p>
                The origin of Minesweeper is unclear. According to <i class="italics"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechRadar">TechRadar</a></i>, <i class="italics">Minesweeper</i> was created
                by Microsoft in the 1990s, but <i class="italics"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a></i>
                commented that Minesweeper gained a lot of inspiration from a "lesser known, tightly designed game",
                <i class="italics"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mined-Out">Mined-Out</a></i> by Ian Andrew for the <i class="italics"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a></i> in 1983. According to
                Andrew, Microsft copied Mined-Out for <i class="italics"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper">Microsoft Minesweeper</a></i>. The
                Microsoft version made its first appearance in 1990, in <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack">Windows Entertainment Pack</a>,
                which was given as part of Windows 3.11. The game was written by Robert Donner and Curt Johnson. Johnson
                acknowledges that his game's design was borrowed from another game, but it was not <i class="italics">Mined-Out</i>, and
                he does not remember which game it is. In 2001, a group called the International Campaign to Ban Winmine
                campaigned for the game's topic to be changed from landmines. The group commented that the game "is an
                offence against the victims of the mines". A later version, found present in Windows Vista's Minesweeper
                offered a tileset with flowers replacing mines as a response. Nowadays, the game is frequently bundled
                with operating systems and desktop environments.

            <h2>Competitive play</h2>
            <p>
                Competitive Minesweeper players aim to complete the game as fast as possible. The players memorize
                patterns to reduce time. Some players use a technique called the "1.5 click", which aids in revealing
                mines, while other players do not flag mines at all. A community of dedicated players has emerged, hence
                the game is played competitively in tournaments.
