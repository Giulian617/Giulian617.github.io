            <h2>A few variants of Minesweeper</h2>
            <p>
                Variants of Minesweeper have been made that expand on the basic concepts and add new game design
                elements. <i>Minesweeper X</i> is a clone of the Microsoft version with improved randomization and more
                statistics, and is popular with players of the game intending to reach a fast time. <i>Arbiter</i> and
                <i>Viennasweeper</i> are also clones, and are used similarly to <i>Minesweeper X</i>. <i>Crossmines</i>
                is a more complex version of the game's base idea, adding linked mines and irregular blocks.
                <i>BeTrapped</i> transposes the game into a mystery game setting. There are several direct clones of
                <i>Microsoft Minesweeper</i> available online.

                Minesweeper was made part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape"><i>Runescape</i></a>
                through a minigame called <i>Vinesweeper</i>. The non-Japanese releases of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver"><i>Pok√©mon HeartGold and
                        SoulSilver</i></a> contained a variation of both Minesweeper and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">Picross</a>. The video game <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft"><i>Minecraft</i></a> released a version of
                Minesweeper in its 215 April Fool's update. The <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphing_calculator">HP-48F graphing calculator</a> includes a
                variant called "Minehunt", where the player has to move safely from one corner of the playfield to the
                other. The only clues given are how many mines are in the squares surrounding the player's current
                position. Google search includes a version of Minesweeper as an easter egg, available by searching the
                game's name.
            </p>
            <p>
                A logic puzzle variant of minesweeper, suitable for playing on paper, starts with some squares already
                revealed. The player cannot reveal any more squares, but must instead mark the reamining mines
                correctly. Unlike the usual form of minesweeper, these puzzles usually have a unique solution. These
                puzzles appeared under the name "tentaizu", Japanese for a star map, in Southwest Airlines' magazine
                <i>Spirit</i> in 2008-2009.
