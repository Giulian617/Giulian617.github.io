			<h2>Rules of the normal minesweeper game</h2>
			<p>
				Minesweeper is a puzzle video game. In the game, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is
				divided into cells. Cells have three states: unopened, opened and flagged. An unopened cell is blank and
				clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged cells are unopened cells marked by the player to
				indicate a potential mine location; some implementations make flagged cells unopenable to reduce the
				risk of uncovering a suspected mine.
			</p>
			<p>
				A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a mined cell, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise,
				the cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a
				blank tile and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be opened. Players can also flag a cel,
				visualise by a flag being put on the location, to denote that they believe a mine to be in that place.
				Flagged cells are still considered unopened, and may be unflagged. In some versions of the game, when
				the number of adjacent mines is equal to the number of adjacent flagged cells, all adjacent non-flagged
				unopened cells will be opened.

			<h2>Objective and strategy</h2>
			<p>
				A game of Minesweeper begins when the player first selects a cell on a board. In some versions of the
				game the first click is guaranteed to be safe; whilst some other variants further guaranteeing that all
				adjacent cells are safe as well. During the game, the player uses information given from the opened
				cells to deduce further cells that are safe to open, iteratively gaining more information to solve the
				board. The player is also given the numver of remaining mines in the board, known as the
				<i>minecount</i>, which is calculatedas the total number of mines subtractd by the number of flagged
				cells(thus the minecount can be negtive if too many flags have been placed).
			</p>
			<p>
				To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine. There is no
				score, however there is a timer recording the time taken to finish the game. Difficulty can be increased
				by adding mines or starting with a larger grid. <i>Microsoft Minesweeper</i> offers three default board
				configurations, usually known as beginner, intermediate and expert, in order of increasing difficulty.
				Beginner is usually on an 8x8 or 9x9 board containing 10 mines, intermediate is usually on a 16x16 board
				with 40 mines and expert is usually on a 30x16 board with 99 mines, however this is usually
				customisable.
